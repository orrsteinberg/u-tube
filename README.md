# U-Tube

YouTube client-side clone. This is a showcase project inspired by the original YouTube website with some customization.
Built with React and Redux (using RTK, which is now recommended as the [official standard way to write Redux logic](https://redux.js.org/redux-toolkit/overview)).

## API proxy

In order to hide the app's private API key, I put together a bare-bones [API proxy](https://www.github.com/orrsteinberg/u-tube-api-proxy) to pass incoming requests to the official YouTube API along with the secret key.
Because YouTube has a daily quota for requests, the proxy also includes a rate limiter.

## About the app

This single-page web app uses YouTube Data API v3 for interacting with YouTube data, and Google OAuth2 for signing in/out and persisting authentication state.
